## Functionality 

The theme of the quiz is my favorite tv show called Dr. Who. The quiz is ten questions long and is prompted by this button.


The quiz then plays the theme of Dr Who while you answer the questons. Do not answer wrong though or you will losse ten second off the timer. The timer is located at the top right of the  page and if you fall under 30 seconds the timer will change colors. The quiz will end when either all 10 questions are answered or the timer reaches 0. This will prompt a page for the user to enter their name and will tell them there score. If they submit their name it is stored to local storage and the page takes them to the highscore page. The user can then either go back to the quiz or delete the highscores from the page and from local Storage
